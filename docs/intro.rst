What is lambeq?
===============

``lambeq`` is an open-source, modular, extensible high-level Python library for experimental :term:`Quantum Natural Language Processing <quantum NLP (QNLP)>` (QNLP), created by `Quantinuum <https://www.quantinuum.com>`_'s QNLP team. At a high level, the library allows the conversion of any sentence to a :term:`quantum circuit`, based on a given :term:`compositional model` and certain parameterisation and choices of :term:`ansätze <ansatz (plural: ansätze)>`, and facilitates :ref:`training <sec-training>` for both quantum and classical NLP experiments. The notes for the latest release can be found :ref:`here <sec-release-notes>`.

``lambeq`` is available for Python 3.10 and higher, on Linux, macOS and Windows. To install, type:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lambeq

or refer to :ref:`sec-installation` for more information. To start the tutorial, go to `Step 1: Sentence Input <tutorials/sentence-input.ipynb>`_. To see the example notebooks, go to :ref:`sec-examples`. To use the command-line interface, read :ref:`sec-cli`. To make your own contributions to ``lambeq``, see :ref:`sec-contributing`.
